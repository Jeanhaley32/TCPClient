# TCPClient
 Simple TCP Client, for reading from connection, and sending raw messages.


 ## Description
 
 This is a simple implemention of a TCP Server using bubble tea to create an interface. 
 Receives text from a TCP connection, and prints that to a window.
 Take user input via a message prompt, and sends that as a message to the TCP server. 

 Another future, more ad-hoc implementation of this in the future will most likely 
 move around structured data for more refined functionality.
