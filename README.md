# TCPClient
 Simple TCP Client, for reading from connection, and sending raw messages.


 ## Description
 
 This is a simple implemention of Bubbletea, used to take text from user input,
 send it to a TCP server, and write that server output to the screen. 

 This is simple in that there is no data structuring. We are just using raw bytes. 

 Another future, more ad-hoc implementation of this in the future will most likely 
 move around structured data for more refined functionality.
